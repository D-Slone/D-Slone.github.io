                          Your favorite marsupial, Crash Bandicoot®, is back! He’s enhanced, entranced and ready-to-dance with the N. Sane Trilogy game collection.
                          Like in the original games, Crash uses spinning and jumping techniques to defeat enemies, smash crates, and collect items such as Wumpa 
                          Fruits, extra lives, and protective Aku Aku masks. The trilogy adds new features across all three games, including unified checkpoints,
                           pause menus and save systems, including both manual and automatic saving, time trials, which were first introduced in Warped, and the
                            ability to play most levels in each game as Crash's sister Coco.

                            Played in an open world with a third-person perspective, players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a witcher, 
                            who seeks to find his adopted daughter on the run from the "Wild Hunt", an otherworldly force determined to capture and utilise her powers.
                             Throughout the game, players battle against the world's many dangers using weapons and magic, interact with various non-player characters,
                              and complete main story quests, side quests, monster contracts, and treasure hunts to acquire experience points and gold used to increase
                               Geralt's various abilities and gear. The game's central story features multiple endings that are determined by Geralt's choices made by 
                               the player during certain points of the story.

                            Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats 
                            before humanity is completely wiped out.

                      <td> Similar to its predecessors, Battlefield 1 is a first-person shooter game that emphasizes teamwork. It is set in the period of World War I, and is inspired 
                          by historical events. Players can make use of World War I weapons, including bolt-action rifles, automatic and semi-automatic rifles, artillery, flamethrowers,
                           and mustard gas to combat opponents. Melee combat was reworked, introducing new melee weapons such as sabres, trench clubs, and shovels
                            into the game. These melee weapons were divided into three groups: heavy, medium and light. Players can also take control of various armored vehicles, including
                             light and heavy tanks, armored trucks, cars, torpedo boats, biplane aircraft, an armored train, Reconnaissance vehicles, a Dreadnought and an LZ 30 Airship, as 
                             well as ride horses into battle. Destructible environments and weapon customization, features present in the previous games, returned in Battlefield 1 and are more dynamic.

                            Similar to its predecessor, Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter game in which players can control both a pilot and their Titans – mecha-style exoskeletons.
                             The pilot has an arsenal of abilities which enhance their efficiency during combat. These abilities include cloaking, zip-lining, and parkour – such as 
                             double-jumping and wall-running – with the aid of a jump kit. These movements can be chained together in order to travel between locations quickly. 
                             The game introduces several new gameplay mechanics: a sliding mechanic, the pulse blade, which is a throwing knife that reveals the location of any nearby
                              enemy, the holo-pilot, a holographic pilot that mimics players' action to confuse enemies, and a grappling hook, which can be used to slingshot players to
                               a building or an enemy it attaches to. The pilots have a large arsenal of gadgets and weapons, such as shotguns, submachine guns, pistols, and grenades to
                                fight against enemies. At close range, players can execute their opponents, and an interruptible execution animation, which shifts to a third-person perspective, will play.

                            The game's main story revolves around the player character and their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set two
                             hundred years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character
                              by improving skills. The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone 
                              the main storyline indefinitely.
